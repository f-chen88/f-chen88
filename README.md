## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### [Fraud Detection using Machine Learning](https://github.com/f-chen88/bnp-paribas-fraud-detection-challenge)
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions by analyzing financial transaction data. The model was developed using **Gradient Boosting** and **Random Forest** algorithms, with an emphasis on optimizing the **Precision-Recall AUC score** to handle class imbalance effectively. The approach involved rigorous feature engineering and model tuning to achieve superior performance.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas
- **Key Achievement**: Secured 1st place in the **ENS Challenge Data** competition by optimizing the model for fraud detection and achieving the highest Precision-Recall AUC score.

### [MNIST dataset using f-GANs](https://github.com/f-chen88/mnist-f-gans-project)
This project focuses on the generation of handwritten digit images using f-GANs (f-divergence Generative Adversarial Networks). The model was developed to generate realistic images from the MNIST dataset, experimenting with various f-divergences like KL-divergence and JS-divergence to study their impact on image quality and precision-recall trade-offs. The project includes training, evaluation, and analysis of generated samples.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Key Achievement**: Developed an effective f-GAN-based generator to produce high-quality handwritten digits, providing valuable insights into the effect of different divergences on generative models.


### [Real Estate Price Prediction](https://github.com/f-chen88/real-estate-price-prediction-challenge)
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using various property characteristics such as location, property type, size, and energy performance. The dataset consists of 40,000 listings and 27 features, and a robust regression model was built using **XGBoost** after extensive preprocessing and feature engineering.
